==========
### Dining Hall Data
  #### Prototype phase
    * Pulling from an aspx page at url http://exeter.edu/student_life/14202_15947.aspx
    * Using JQuery and relying on the formatting of the page to stay the same for the prototype phase.
    * While this is safe for now, I should probably pull from whatever database in the final version.  Ill talk to ITS later
  #### Serverless app
    * So this definitely could run without a server in theory, but I may have to implement a node server.
    * Ideally I will run the script in my page context and return all on client side, but we will have to see what happens
